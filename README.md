IT'S CALLED CEED BECAUSE IT MAKES A **TREE** FROM C CODE

Produces an AST from preprocessed C source code using jison, a C grammar, and some sunlight.

This is a library producing nodes suitable for [selectree](https://github.com/cosmicexplorer/selectree). Anything that modifies syntax goes here. This shouldn't require a lot of changes after it's written.
